Watt definition

Watt is the unit of power (symbol: W).

The watt unit is named after James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine.

One watt is defined as the energy consumption rate of one joule per second.

1W = 1J / 1s

One watt is also defined as the current flow of one ampere with voltage of one volt.

1W = 1V × 1A

Kilowatt definition

One kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts (W):

1kW = 1000W

One kilowatt is defined as energy consumption of 1000 joules for 1 second:

1kW = 1000J / 1s

One kilowatt is equal to 1000000 milliwatts:

1kW = 1000000mW
Kilowatt examples
Example #1

What is the power consumption in kW when energy of 30000 joules was released during 10 seconds?

Solution:

P(kW) = 30000J / 10s / 1000 = 3kW
Example #2

What is the power consumption when consuming 6kWh for 3 hours?

Solution:

P(kW) = 6kWh / 3h = 2kW
